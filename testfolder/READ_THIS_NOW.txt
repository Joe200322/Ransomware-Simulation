=== THIS IS A CONTROLLED EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION ===

This folder has been encrypted as part of a cybersecurity training exercise.
No real harm has been done and no payment is required or possible.

What happened:
- Files were encrypted using AES (via Fernet)
- A dummy user account was created
- This note was dropped

How to recover (for demonstration):
1. Find the encryption key (in this simulation: visible in console / memory forensics)
2. Run the recover.py script with the key
3. Use cleanup.py to remove the dummy user

Instructor/Student note: This is NOT real ransomware.
Purpose: Learn encryption, forensics, recovery, and defense.
